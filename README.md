# Full-Stack Developer with JS ( Javascript )
This Is the roadmap to guide you to " how become a full-stack developer with javascript? "

## Getting Started

### Why Javascript?
With the Javascript you can build a web application, mobile application and even desktop application with just one baseline technology.

***
## Front-End Development

### HTML5 & CSS3
Start with learning HTML5 & CSS3 first. HTML is a short for hypertext markup language. HTML is a markup language not a programming language that helps layout the structure of a website.
CSS3 is a next skill you should learn. CSS stands for cascading style sheets. It’s much of a design rules that helps to make a web page looks good.

### Javascript
Once you completed your HTML5 & CSS3, now It's time to pick-up a Javascript.
Once you learn Javascript basics then you can start learning some popular libraries and frameworks that’s going to speed up your implementation.
Libraries and frameworks of Javascript are built on top of Javascript, but they have added features systems that help you speed up the work. Just like power tools will help you do more with less effort and do it faster. Javascript libraries and frameworks help you do just that and there are different power tools aka different libraries for different purposes.

### Javascript Library & Framework

#### 1) jQuery
So the first and the most important library that you must learn after you’ve learned Javascript basics is jQuery. jQuery is a library on top of Javascript that helps you build cool website features. 
For instance, jQuery will help you build interactive menus, sliders, to-do app, button effects, animation and all the way up to a mini application. Next, you should learn at least one modern front-end development framework.

#### 2) React.js OR Angular.js
You can either learn Angularjs or Reactjs. Angular.js and React.js are Javascript frameworks that put structure around building a modern web application. They will help you building an entire application.

[ Once you learn all these things, congratulations! You are considered a front-end developer.
Now, all you need is to do a lot of practice so that you become good at these things. Now of course there are many pieces of wisdom and tricks that you must know as a developer to be good at your job. ]

## Back-End Development
Next, let’s move on to back-end development. Now, you can learn other back-end technologies like PHP, Java, C#, Python, Ruby etc and enter the different worlds they’re out there. But, here we'll focus on only one Javascript.

### Node JS
You just now need to learn node.js which is a technology that enables Javascript to become a back-end programming language. The language is the same, you still know Javascript that’s the same baseline, node.js just extends Javascript’s capability to the back-end as well.

### Express JS
You must learn a little bit more about how a back-end works and built back-end APIs. And this is simply accomplished by learning Express.js.
Express.js is a Javascript library, that helps you build APIs, web APIs with Javascript. Once you know this, you’re a back-end developer!

[ Once you know both Front-End & Back-End, you are considered a Full-Stack Developer. A term used for someone who knows front-end development and back-end development combined. ]
